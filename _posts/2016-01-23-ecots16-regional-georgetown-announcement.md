## The Conference

We are happy to announce the eECOTS 2016 Regional Conference at Georgetown (**eCOTS16-RCG**).  This is a one-day gathering to enhance [eCOTS 2016](https://www.causeweb.org/ecots/ecots16/), the biennial electronic meeting of [USCOTS](https://www.causeweb.org/uscots/), the United States Conference on the Teaching of Statistics.

**eCOTS16-RCG** is set for May 20, 2016 on the campus of [Georgetown College](http://www.georgetowncollege.edu/) in Central Kentucky.  The conference receives sponsorship from eCOTS 2016.  Participants should register for eCOTS prior to registering for **eCOTS16-RCG**.
