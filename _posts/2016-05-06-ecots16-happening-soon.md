## Registration Deadline

The Regional Conference is less than two weeks away.  As of this writing we have eleven confirmed participants, and I expect two more to confirm very soon.  If you plan to attend please complete your registration by Thursday May 12 so I can finalize plans with our caterer.

As a reminder, the registration procedure is as follows.  Go to the [eCOTS](https://www.causeweb.org/cause/ecots/ecots16) site to register for eCOTS itself.  As part of the process you will be asked to check which regional mini-conference you wish to attend, so don't forget to check the Georgetown College box!

Then (and this is important!) email me to let me (see the Contact link in the sidebar) know of your intent to come.  Registration at eCOTS plus an email of intent to me complete your registration for the Georgetown Regional Conference. Thanks to support from eCOTS registration is free, and breakfast and lunch will be provided at no charge to you.

## Speakers

In additon to our keynote address from Bill Rayens of the University of Kentucky, we have an exciting set of four contributed talks by participants.  Consult the Schedule on the sidebar for further details, including abstracts of all talks.
