## Details on the Keynote Address

Our keynote speaker is William S. Rayens of the Department of Statistics at the University of Kentucky.  Bill has kindly provided some details of his talk:

### Student-Centered Learning:  Room Design Matters

William S. Rayens, Ph.D
Associate Chair and Director of Educational Initiatives
Department of Statistics
University of Kentucky
 
**Abstract**

>There are fundamental reasons to inherently value a student-centered, activity-based classroom in which students are active participants in their own learning.  This can be especially important in a statistical reasoning course where students need to appreciate the role of the mathematics that underwrite the familiar formulae, but are students not well served by having a purely mathematical encounter.  At the University of Kentucky we have become profoundly aware of the challenges that the physical classroom space poses for student-centered learning and in this talk we will describe a space we have constructed that we believe is a true game-changer.   This pilot room was designed by the speaker and was used as a model for twelve TEAL (Technology Enabled Active Learning) classrooms in the new $112 million Academic Sciences Building, set to open in the fall of 2016.  We will describe these spaces and discuss the critical role of technology in the design and how we are using that technology to facilitate a student-centered pedagogy.

I'm sure we all look forward to Bill's address!

## Call for Abstracts

But we want to hear from you, too!  If in addition to attending you would like to present at our conference, please send me a title and abstract.  For now, let's plan on limiting contributed talks to twenty minutes each.
